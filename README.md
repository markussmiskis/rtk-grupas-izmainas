 ## RTK Timetable changes

This Node.js application serves the changes in the timetable for the specific group when you make a GET request to the root URL (`/`) with the group as a parameter.

```
curl -X GET https://example.com/DT1-2
```
### Usage

1. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. To start the server, run:

```
npm start
```

The server will listen on port 1720 by default.
You can change this in the rest.js file.
